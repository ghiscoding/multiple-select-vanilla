## Description
Multiple-Select-Vanilla is a fork of the popular [Multiple-Select (jQuery)](https://github.com/wenzhixin/multiple-select) library (thanks to @wenzhixin for this great project). This fork was based on its latest known version at the time, which was `v1.5.2`, but later updated to [`v1.7.0`](https://github.com/wenzhixin/multiple-select/releases/tag/1.7.0). The main difference from the original lib is that we dropped jQuery in favor of native browser code and this mean zero external dependency. As a bonus, a few extra features were also added to the library and you can see them listed below [Changes vs Original lib](#changes-vs-original-lib-multiple-select).

This lib allows you to select multiple elements with checkboxes :).

To get started take a look at the [Live demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/) for all available options and methods that the library offers.

## Demo
Take a look at the [**Live demo**](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/) to see all available options/methods (there's a lot). 
You can also take a look at the "[Used by](#used-by)" section below to see and try live real world Open Source projects taking advantage of this library.

### Fully tested with [![Playwright](https://img.shields.io/badge/tested%20with-Playwright-45ba4b.svg?logo=playwright)](https://playwright.dev/)

The [Live demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/) website is also helpful to run a full suite of E2E tests by using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), all project examples have dedicated Playwright tests.

## Changes vs Original lib (`multiple-select`)
Changes and new options:
- dropped jQuery requirement and rewrote with browser native code.
- rewritten in TypeScript to also provide typings support (`d.ts`)
- make the lib CSP compliant (see [CSP Compliance](#csp-compliance) section below)
- add E2E tests, with Playwright, for all existing examples (over 65 of them)
- revamped the UI in v3.x to give it a more Modern Look:
  - improved CSS styling by using SVG icons (CSS/SASS variables are also availables)
  - new Dark Mode
  - replace tabIndex with a more intuitive navigation & highlight by using arrow keys (or mouse hover)
  - show 3 different states on multiple selections (none " ", partial "-" or all "ðŸ—¸")
- add extra options:
  - `autoAdjustDropHeight` will automatically adjust the drop (up/down) height by available space (see [demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/#/options30))
  - `autoAdjustDropPosition` will find best position (top/bottom) by its available space (see [demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/#/options29))
  - `autoAdjustDropWidthByTextSize` automatically set the drop width size by reading the widest list option width
  - `dataTest` will add a `data-test` attribute on the `.ms-parent` and `.ms-drop` divs for easier E2E testing
  - `useSelectOptionLabel` will use the `<option label="">` which can be used to display shorter text of selected options.
    - example: display "1,3" as label instead of "January,March" (see [demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/#/options31))
  - `useSelectOptionLabelToHtml` similar to `useSelectOptionLabel` but also renders HTML.
  - `renderOptionLabelAsHtml` will render selected options as HTML code (see [demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/#/options27))
  - `sanitizer` can be used to sanitize HTML code and prevent XSS cross-site scripting attacks (see [demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/#/options32)).
  - `showOkButton` adds an "OK" button at the end of the multiple select option list (see [demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/#/options25))
  - `showSearchClear` show a clear filter button on the search filter input (see [demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/#/options34))
  - `diacriticParser` custom parser to normalize diacritic symbols when filtering select list (see [demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/#/options35))
  - `darkMode` to enable our new **Dark Mode** Theme (see [demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/#/options38))
  - `infiniteScroll` option (see [demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/#/options36))
  - `onFilterClear` callback that will be executed when the filter gets cleared (see [demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/#/events))
  - `onClose(reason)` callback that will be executed when the dropdown closes (see [demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/#/events))

## CSP Compliance
The library is now CSP (Content Security Policy) compliant, however there are some exceptions to be aware of. When using any HTML strings as template (when using `textTemplate`, `labelTemplate`, `renderOptionLabelAsHtml` or `useSelectOptionLabelToHtml`), you will not be fully compliant unless you return [`TrustedHTML`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TrustedHTML). You can achieve this by using the `sanitizer` method in combo with an external library like [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) (recommended) to return `TrustedHTML` as shown below and with that in place you will be CSP compliant.

```typescript
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';
import { multipleSelect, MultipleSelectInstance } from 'multiple-select-vanilla';

const ms1 = multipleSelect('#select1', {
   name: 'my-select',
   single: false,
   useSelectOptionLabelToHtml: true,
   sanitizer: (html) => DOMPurify.sanitize(html, { RETURN_TRUSTED_TYPE: true }), // return TrustedHTML Type
   data: [
      { text: '<i class="fa fa-star"></i> January', value: 1 },
      { text: '<i class="fa fa-star"></i> February', value: 2 },
   ]
});
```
with this code in place, we can now use the following CSP meta tag (which is what we use in the demo [index.html](https://github.com/ghiscoding/multiple-select-vanilla/blob/main/packages/demo/index.html#L7))
```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self';style-src 'self' data:; img-src * 'self' data: https:; require-trusted-types-for 'script'; trusted-types dompurify">
```
> **Note** that in our demo we are actually adding `unsafe-inline` simply because we are using Vite (which is not CSP compliant in Dev mode), but the library should work nonetheless without `unsafe-inline`.

### Installation / Structure
There are multiple ways to install and use the library, you can see below the folder structure of the distribution files
1. `dist/browser`: Standalone build which assigns `multipleSelect` on the `window.multipleSelect` object
   - browser standalone means that you can simply load it with `<script></script>` and then `multipleSelect('#mySelect')`
   - only ESM build (`.js`) are provided, you will need to load it with `<script type="module">`
2. `esm`: to use as ESM with `import from 'multiple-select-vanilla'`

```
dist/
  browser/
    multiple-select.js              # ESM build, use with: window.multipleSelect
  locales/
    multiple-select-all-locales.js  # all-in-1 locales as ESM
    ..
    multiple-select-fr-FR.js        # French locale as ESM
    ...
  styles/                           # CSS and SASS Stylings
    css/
    sass/
  index.d.ts                        # d.ts Type Definitions
  multiple-select.js                # ESM, used by: import from
```
