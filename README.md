## Official Release now available ðŸ“£
We now have a fully working and official release including a [**Live demo**](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/) for all available options/methods. You can also take a look at the [Used by](#used-by) section to see real applications taking advantage of this library in production.

## Description
Multiple-Select-Vanilla is a fork of the popular [Multiple-Select (jQuery)](https://github.com/wenzhixin/multiple-select) library, it was based on its latest known version at the time which was [`v1.5.2`](https://github.com/wenzhixin/multiple-select/releases/tag/1.5.2). The main difference from the original lib is that we dropped jQuery and we now use native browser code and we have zero external dependency. We also added a few extra features which you can see in the section below ([Changes vs Original lib](#changes-vs-original-lib)). 
 
This lib allows you to select multiple elements with checkboxes :).

To get started take a look at the [Live demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/) for all available options and methods that the library offers.


### Fully tested with [![Playwright](https://img.shields.io/badge/tested%20with-Playwright-45ba4b.svg?logo=playwright)](https://playwright.dev/)

The [Live demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/) website is also used by [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for E2E testing of the library, all examples are covered with Playwright tests.

## Changes vs Original lib
New Multiple-Select Options:
- dropped jQuery requirement and replaced necessary code with browser native code.
- written in TypeScript which also brings typings support
- added new features:
  - `showOkButton` to add an "OK" button at the end of multiple select option list (see [demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/#/options25))
  - `autoAdjustDropHeight` will automatically adjust the drop (up/down) height with available space (see [demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/#/options30))
  - `autoAdjustDropPosition` will find best position (top/bottom) by its available space (see [demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/#/options29))
  - `autoAdjustDropWidthByTextSize` automatically set the drop width size from the widest list option width
  - `useSelectOptionLabel` will use the `<option label="">` (from select option value) that can be used to display shorter selected option values.
    - example: value "1,3" instead of "January,March" (see [demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/#/options31))
  - `useSelectOptionLabelToHtml` similar to `useSelectOptionLabel` but also renders HTML.
  - `renderOptionLabelAsHtml` will render selected options as HTML (see [demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/#/options27))
  - `sanitizer` can be used to sanitize HTML code and prevent XSS cross-site scripting attacks (see [demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/#/options32)).
  - `dataTest` will add a `data-test` attribute on the `.ms-parent` and `.ms-drop` divs for easier E2E testing
