## Stable Release
We now have a fully working and official release including a [**Live demo**](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/) for displaying all available options/methods. You can also take a look at the "[Used by](#used-by)" section below to see real world applications taking advantage of this library.

## Description
Multiple-Select-Vanilla is a fork of the popular [Multiple-Select (jQuery)](https://github.com/wenzhixin/multiple-select) library (thanks to @wenzhixin for this great lib). This fork was based on its latest known version at the time, which was `v1.5.2`, but later updated to [`v1.6.0`](https://github.com/wenzhixin/multiple-select/releases/tag/1.6.0). The main difference from the original lib is that we dropped jQuery and we now use native code and this mean zero external dependency. We also added a few extra features which you can see in the list below ([Changes vs Original lib](#changes-vs-original-lib)).

This lib allows you to select multiple elements with checkboxes :).

To get started take a look at the [Live demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/) for all available options and methods that the library offers.


### Fully tested with [![Playwright](https://img.shields.io/badge/tested%20with-Playwright-45ba4b.svg?logo=playwright)](https://playwright.dev/)

The [Live demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/) website is also used by [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for E2E testing of the library, all examples are covered with Playwright tests.

## Installation

```sh
npm install multiple-select-vanilla
```

## Changes vs Original lib (`multiple-select`)
New Multiple-Select Options:
- dropped jQuery requirement and replaced necessary code with browser native code.
- written in TypeScript which also brings typings support
- add extra features:
  - `autoAdjustDropHeight` will automatically adjust the drop (up/down) height by available space (see [demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/#/options30))
  - `autoAdjustDropPosition` will find best position (top/bottom) by its available space (see [demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/#/options29))
  - `autoAdjustDropWidthByTextSize` automatically set the drop width size from the widest list option width
  - `dataTest` will add a `data-test` attribute on the `.ms-parent` and `.ms-drop` divs for easier E2E testing
  - `useSelectOptionLabel` will use the `<option label="">` (from select option value) that can be used to display shorter text of selected options.
    - example: will show "1,3" instead of "January,March" (see [demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/#/options31))
  - `useSelectOptionLabelToHtml` similar to `useSelectOptionLabel` but also renders HTML.
  - `renderOptionLabelAsHtml` will render selected options as HTML code (see [demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/#/options27))
  - `sanitizer` can be used to sanitize HTML code and prevent XSS cross-site scripting attacks (see [demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/#/options32)).
  - `showOkButton` to add an "OK" button at the end of the multiple select option list (see [demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/#/options25))
  - `showSearchClear` show a clear button on the search filter input (see [demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/#/options34))
  - `diacriticParser` can be used to parse and normalize diacritic signs when filtering select list (accents) (see [demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/#/options35))

## CSP Compliance
The library is now CSP (Content Security Policy) compliant since `v0.6.0`, however there are some exceptions to be aware of. When using any html string as template (with `textTemplate`, `labelTemplate`, `renderOptionLabelAsHtml` or `useSelectOptionLabelToHtml`), you will not be fully compliant unless you return `TrustedHTML`. You can achieve this by using the `sanitizer` method in combo with [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) to return `TrustedHTML` as shown below and with that in place you will again be CSP compliant.

```typescript
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';
import { multipleSelect, MultipleSelectInstance } from 'multiple-select-vanilla';

const ms1 = multipleSelect('#select1', {
   name: 'my-select',
   single: false,
   useSelectOptionLabelToHtml: true,
   sanitizer: (html) => DOMPurify.sanitize(html, { RETURN_TRUSTED_TYPE: true }),
   data: [
      {
         text: '<i class="fa fa-star"></i> January',
         value: 1,
      },
   ]
});
```
with this code in place, we can use the following CSP meta tag (which is what we use in the lib demo, ref: [index.html](https://github.com/ghiscoding/multiple-select-vanilla/blob/main/demo/index.html#L7))
```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self';style-src 'self' data:; img-src * 'self' data: https:; require-trusted-types-for 'script'; trusted-types dompurify">
```
**Note** in our demo we are actually adding `unsafe-inline` simply because we are using Vite (which is not CSP compliant in Dev mode), but the library should work nonetheless without `unsafe-inline`.

### Installation / Structure
There are multiple ways to use the library
1. `dist/browser`: Standalone build which assigns `multipleSelect` on the `window.multipleSelect` object
   - browser standalone means that you can simply load it with `<script></script>` and then `multipleSelect('#mySelect')`
   - 2 builds are available CJS (`.cjs`) and ESM (`.js`) and for ESM you will need to load it with `<script type="module">`
2. `cjs`: to use as CommonJS with `require('multiple-select-vanilla')`
3. `esm`: to use as ESM with `import from 'multiple-select-vanilla'`

```
dist/
  browser/
    multiple-select.js              # ESM build, use with: window.multipleSelect
    multiple-select.cjs             # CJS (CommonJS) build, use with: window.multipleSelect
  cjs/
    multiple-select.cjs             # CJS (CommonJS), use with: require()
  esm/
    multiple-select.js              # ESM, use with: import from
  locales/
    multiple-select-all-locales.cjs # all-in-1 locales as CJS
    multiple-select-all-locales.js  # all-in-1 locales as ESM
    ..
    multiple-select-fr-FR.cjs       # French locale as CJS
    multiple-select-fr-FR.js        # French locale as ESM
    ...
  styles/                           # CSS and SASS Stylings
    css/
    sass/
  types/                            # d.ts Type Definitions
```

#### Pull Request Contribution

Before submitting a PR (pull request), please make sure that you followed these steps for your PR to succeed:
1. make sure that you already ran `pnpm install`
2. run the Prettier code formatting npm script (or use step 3)
   - `pnpm run prettier:write`
3. run a full Build (this will also run Prettier format, so you could skip step 2)
